STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS WRITING THE JAVASCIPT CODE

Step 1: Selecting Elements
- "document.querySelectorAll('.tabs')": This line selects all elements with the class "tabs" and stores them in the tabs NodeList. These elements represent the tab buttons.
- "document.querySelectorAll('.tab-content')": This line selects all elements with the class "tab-content" and stores them in the tabContents NodeList. These elements represent the content sections associated with the tabs.

Step 2: Adding Event Listeners
- "tabs.forEach(function(btn) {...})": This loop iterates through each tab button in the tabs NodeList.
- "btn.addEventListener("click", function() {...})": An event listener for the "click" event is added to each tab button. This means that when a tab button is clicked, the function inside the event listener is executed.

Step 3: Hiding All Tab Contents
- "tabContents.forEach(function(content) {...})": This loop iterates through all tab content sections in the tabContents NodeList.
- "content.style.display = "none"; ": For each content section, this line sets its display property to "none," effectively hiding all tab contents initially.

Step 4: Showing the Selected Tab Content
- "this.getAttribute("data-tab") ": This line retrieves the value of the data-tab attribute from the clicked tab button. The data-tab attribute specifies which tab content to display.
- "document.getElementById(tabId) ": This line selects the tab content associated with the clicked tab button using its id.
- "selectedTabContent.style.display = "block"; ": It sets the display property of the selected tab content to "block," making it visible.

Step 5: Managing the "Active" Class
- "tabs.forEach(function(tab) {...}) ": Another loop iterates through all tab buttons, removing the "active" class from each of them to reset their appearance.
- "this.classList.add('active'); ": The "active" class is added to the clicked tab button to visually indicate that it's currently active.

Step 6: Automatically Opening the First Tab
- "document.getElementById("open-first") ": This line retrieves the element with the id "open-first" from the HTML document.
- ".click() ": The click() method is called on the retrieved element, simulating a click event on it.

Concepts Used:

DOM Manipulation: The code interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify the appearance and behavior of HTML elements.
Event Handling: Event listeners are used to respond to user interactions (click events) on the tab buttons.
Iterating Through NodeLists: The forEach method is employed to iterate through NodeLists, allowing actions to be performed on each element.
Custom Data Attributes: The data-tab attribute is used to associate tab buttons with specific content sections.
CSS Class Manipulation: The code adds and removes CSS classes to control the appearance and behavior of elements.
Simulating Click Events: The click() method is used to programmatically trigger a click event on an element.
Default Behavior: The code sets up the default behavior of opening the first tab when the page loads automatically.
