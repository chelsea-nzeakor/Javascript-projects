STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS WRITING THE JAVASCIPT CODE

1. Select All Buttons: We start by selecting all elements with the class "down-btn" and store them in the 'accButtons' variable.

2. Initialization: We initialize two variables, 'currentTab' and 'currentTabButton', to keep track of the currently open panel and button. Initially, they are set to 'null'.

3. Loop Through Buttons: We use a 'forEach' loop to go through each button in the 'accButtons' collection.

4. Click Event Listener: For each button, we add a click event listener. When a button is clicked, the code inside the event listener is executed.

5. Find Associated Elements: We find the parent accordion container using 'this.closest(".accordion")'. This helps us identify which accordion section this button belongs to. We also find the associated hide panel using 'querySelector'.

6. Close Previous Panel: We check if there is a previously open panel, (currentTab) and if it's different from the current panel. If so, we close the previously open panel by removing its maxHeight and the rotation class from the button.

7. Toggle Panel Visibility: We toggle the visibility of the current panel. If the panel is open, we close it by removing its maxHeight and the rotation class from the button. If the panel is closed, we open it by setting its maxHeight and adding the rotation class to the button.

8. Update Current Panel and Button: We update the 'currentTab' and 'currentTabButton' variables to keep track of the currently open panel and button.

This code ensures that when you click a button, it opens the associated panel, closes the previously open panel (if any), and rotates the button icon appropriately.

CONCEPTS USED
1. DOM Manipulation:
Selecting DOM elements using querySelector and querySelectorAll.
Accessing and modifying element properties like style, textContent, and classList.

2.Event Handling:
Adding event listeners to DOM elements using addEventListener.
Handling user interactions, such as clicks, with event handlers.

3. Conditional Statements:
Using if statements to create conditional logic.
Checking and comparing conditions to determine the state of the accordion panels.

4. Iterating Over Arrays:
Looping through elements in an array using forEach.
Accessing and manipulating elements within a loop.

5. CSS Transitions:
Using CSS transitions for smooth animations, such as expanding and collapsing panels.
Changing CSS styles dynamically to create visual effects.

6. Element Traversal:
Navigating the DOM tree using methods like closest to find parent elements and querySelector to find child elements.

7. State Management:
Tracking and managing the state of the accordion, such as keeping track of the currently open panel.

8. Toggling Classes:
Adding and removing CSS classes to change the appearance and behavior of elements, such as rotating icons or hiding content.1.
