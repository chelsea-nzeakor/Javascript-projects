STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS WRITING THE JAVASCIPT CODE

Step 1: HTML
In the search input (<input id="search">), add the onkeyup attribute to trigger the search() function whenever the user types:

Step 2: JavaScript Functionality
JavaScript Function: Create a JavaScript function to handle the search functionality. In this case, the function is named search().

Step 3: Access Elements
Access Elements: Inside the search() function, access the necessary HTML elements using the document.getElementById() method.

Step 4: Capture Input
Capture Input: Capture the user's input from the search bar and convert it to uppercase for case-insensitive filtering.

Step 5: Loop Through Menu Items
Loop Through Menu Items: Use a for loop to iterate through the menu items (list items).

Step 6: Filter and Display Items
Filter and Display Items: Within the loop, access each menu item's anchor (<a>) element, and compare its text (menu item name) with the search input.

JavaScript Concepts Used:

1. Document Object Model (DOM): JavaScript interacts with the HTML document's structure and content using DOM methods and properties.

2. Event Handling: The onkeyup event triggers the search() function when the user types in the search input field.

3. Variables: Variables like input, searchFilter, ul, and li are used to store and manipulate data.

4. Loops: A for loop is used to iterate through the list of menu items.

5. Conditional Statements: An if statement is used to compare the search input with menu item names and decide whether to display or hide items.
